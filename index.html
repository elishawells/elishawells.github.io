                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I’m interested in coming into the IT field to focus on software development and machine learning. As of now, I’m currently studying the fundamentals of technology at ITWorks. During this program, I’ve obtained my Cisco IT Essentials certification and the Comptia A+.</p>
                <p>
                Being 19, I grew up using technology devices like phones, computers, and tablets. The basic knowledge of fixing and maintaining end-user products is second nature to me. I’m interested in artificial intelligence (A.I.) so after obtaining the fundamentals, I want to use that to my advantage and be the best I can be in software development and all branches of IT. No one can tell the future, but it is clear that A.I. will be one of the most impactful changes in the near future. I want to use my youth to study and be well involved in the development of this technology.</p>
